# machine_learning_coursework
University project aiming to explore ML methods like Iterated Conditional Modes(ICM), Variational Bayes and Gibbs sampling for a Bayesian model applied to denoise corrupted images. Implemented with Python and Numpy.
A Gaussian Process implementation for function sampling is also provided.
